# My Personal Website

*See it here* - [*Dibbendu Koley*](https://dibbendukoley.web.app/)

This is an update to my previous website which looked like trash. This website on the contrary is very beautiful and very responsive. I first made the design on Adobe XD which took me few weeks to complete as I was still learning the software but after being done with the design I coded everything by myself on HTML and CSS (SASS). It also has few JavaScript elements to help with some functionality like horizontal scroll on About > 3D Design when opened on smaller screen size.

# `NOTE`

This is clearly not the most optimized version. I will update as I learn! Also this website was made last year (2020). Check out my current project- [***GEO VISUALIZER***](https://github.com/RuinTwraith/geo-visualizer)
